## TWXP 2.7 Installer

## we need your help!

I would love to continue working on this application, but I need your help. 
I am currently legally blind and I need your support to continue.
Since the current bots are abandoned I would love to start working on a new bot.
Any donation you can make is greatly appreciated!
