<p class="style1">First we would like to give thanks to the people who's scripts and/or ideas were used for the bot: <br />
  Oz, Cherokee, LoneStar, Mind Dagger, The Bounty Hunter, SupG, Dynarri, Alexio, Xide, Phx, Rincrast, Voltron, Traitor, Ender. </p>
<p class="style1">We used bits and pieces and / or public scripts and / or ideas for a lot of the early stages of the Bot. <br />
  This has been a work in progress for more than a year now. </p>
<p class="style1">Mind Dagger, The Bounty Hunter, and LoneStar all directly contributed to this at one time or another. <br />This set of scripts takes some time to learn and get used to.  Once you get comfortable with it you will better understand its potential. </p>
<p class="style1">1.  <strong>Installation</strong><br />
  Unzip the MOMBot.zip file.  Directory setup is vital to the bot use.  The folder structure should look like this:</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<table width="872" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="300"><span class="style1"><img src="folder_structure.jpg" width="188" height="594" /></span></td>
    <td width="562"><p class="style1">The __mom_bot.cts file can be placed and run anywhere.  (Personally I leave it in my script directory). The MomBot Folder MUST be inside the TWX folder. </p>
      <p class="style1"> Prior to running the script you should ensure that your settings for user name, password and game letter are set up in the TWX setup.  Now run the __mom_bot.cts script.  You will be prompted for a name.  This name IS case sensitive.  After you start the bot will grab specific game information ie.. ship info, game settings, ship settings, stardock and class 0's if in database.  It will quickly exit and re-enter the game.</p>
      <p class="style1">All these settings can be changed later by accessing the preferences menu by pressing TAB-~ </p>
    <p class="style1">You are now ready to use the bot.  For other users to login to the Bot all they have to do is send a corporate memo.  Nothing else is required.  This method has more security than the hail / ss method and is also easier.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1">2. <strong>Some of the bot features:</strong></p>
<p class="style1">[SELF COMMANDS] </p>
<p class="style1"> Self commands can be accessed using the &gt; key or the up arrow key.  For example.  &gt;citkill on<br />
  would fire up the citkill script (Must be at citadel). You can access which commands are available by doing &gt;? or &gt;help at the command prompt.</p>
<p class="style1">The self command prompt keeps a history of the last 100 commands entered. You can access the history by pressing the UP arrow once for each step backwards. </p>
<p class="style1">SWATH users: The advanced command prompt will not work with SWATH, because the up arrow is already mapped by SWATH. Also, SWATH does not render the ANSI correctly for the history. In order to use the bot and have it display correctly, go to the preferences menu (TAB-~) and change the prompt to SWATH prompt.  I suggest using ZOC or some other terminal program to get all the benefits of the bot. </p>
<p class="style1">[HOT KEYS]</p>
<p class="style1">You can access many of the bot commands by using predefined hot keys. The hot keys can be accessed by pressing &gt;help or &gt;? and are as follows:</p>
<p class="style1">I will further document each command at a later time.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0">

    <td width="30%"><span class="style1">&lt;TAB-K&gt; Auto Kill</span></td>
    <td width="70%"><span class="style1">From citadel, the bot will fire up citkill.  If you are at the command menu it will attempt to kill any non-corpie.  If in Fed it will NOT attack Federals or any fed safe player. It also will avoid empty ships and aliens.</span></td>

<p class="style1">[SCRIPT HOT KEYS] </p>
<p class="style1">If you are going to use script hot keys, in your TWX directory you will need the following file: _MOM_HOTKEYSCRIPTS.TXT  This file allows you to set paths for quick script loading.  The file should be formatted something like this on each line:</p>
<p class="style1"> [path] [script name]</p>
<p class="style1">Example: </p>
<table width="783" border="0">

<p class="style1">You can list a total of 10 scripts in this way. This is NOT the same as adding a command to the bot. This is simply adding access to external scripts. This will number them accordingly 1, 2, 3 ect...  Tab-Q will show a list menu of the scripts, but you can fire it off each directly by TAB-1, TAB-2, TAB-3...etc.</p>
<p class="style1">[EXTERNAL COMMANDS]</p>
<p class="style1">  Corpies can access each of the commands by subspace calls.  For example, if my bot name is jack.  a corpie could send on subspace: &quot;jack citkill on&quot; and that would fire up my citkill (assuming you logged in already). </p>
<p class="style1">You can get a list of the commands and modes available by doing either &gt;help or &gt;? or those commands on subspace by doing 'botname help or 'botname ? </p>
<p class="style1">[ADDING NEW COMMANDS/MODES/DAEMONS]</p>
<p class="style1">This is a important part of the bot features.  Do you have a favorite script that you want to access through the bot?  Well, now you can add in your own bot commands WITHOUT editing the source code of the bot.  Compile the script and re-name the file to the name of the command you want.  </p>
<p class="style1">Example:  You have your own tri-conn script.  You compile it and rename it Tricon.cts.  Place that file in the modes directory under the Cashing sub.  Then you can call the command through the bot.  You do not have to restart the bot after adding in a script module. Just simply call it using &gt;tricon or 'jack tricon </p>
<p class="style1">An example of turning a standalone script into a bot script can be found in the MomBot directory called StripExample.ts </p>
<p class="style1">Here are a list of many of the bot variables that can be accessed by loadVar: </p>

<p class="style1">It is important to note to scripters that the location variables (r,a,s,b, and h) can be used in the command line and are automatically translated into the sector numbers that are defined for them. If you want to use those variable letters in your bot command, you will need to grab them using Getword or some other method directly from the $command_user_line. The translation only happens to the $parmx variables. </p>
