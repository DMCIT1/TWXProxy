Author:		RammaR
Revision Date:	7/29/05


Description:
------------
This is an Express Warp style charging / gridding script best used early
in the game for 'bulk' gridding.  Set it with a minimum turn and fighter
limit, then from your starting sector it will charge to the closest unfigged
sector you have, and so on. Please note that it requires a ZTM. 


Updates:
--------
1.11 -- Added Unlimited turn capaiblity, however still requires a ZTM.
	Fixed Density reporting issues.


Features:
---------
- Charges groups of up to 10 sectors at a time.

- Status window helps you keep track of what sectors are being gridded.

- Performs density scans and alerts you to any strange readings.

- Very simple and fast for early bulk gridding.

Note: Run the script with CN9 = Space, it will build the macros to abort
the displays based on your menu selections.
