Description:
------------
This is a complete Planet Gridding script that includes modes for:

1) Solo Planet Gridding 
2) Gridding w/Planet Driver 
3) Gridding w/Planet Driver & Safe Ship - (for move delay games) 
4) Planet Driver 

It moves one sector at a time as the user selects which "Door" to
grid.  As with all gridding, some common sense is needed to decide
when and where is best to grid. Try not to grid adjacent if an
enemy L6 planet is in sector with you! 

Features:
---------

- Several safeties to reduce the risk of being P-dropped or photoned.

- Special options menu has preset macro's to:
   - Holo Scan
   - Deploy Armid Mines
   - Deploy Personal Limpets (to clear a corpie)
   - Deploy Corporate Limpets
   - Log-out / Log-in to clear sector or pickup a limpet.

- The gridding cycle is automated and calls the planet before it
  actually grids the sector for maximum speed and safety.

- It will try to avoid gridding sectors if the density has just
  changed. (for example an adjacent p-drop)

- Option to try and spoof an enemy's density scanning photon script
  before gridding the next sector.  (it will drop 8 additional figs
  in sector and pick them up before gridding.)
