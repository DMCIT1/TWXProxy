As Promised, I created a new script called LS_SLoad10.cts  aka LoneStar's Script Loader v1.0 ...posted on Grimy's

on initial run, it creates a blank template to be populated with your favorite scripts.  There are 5 categories of scripts, for a grand total of 50 maximum scripts that can be inputted.

Once you've setup the LS_Scripts.txt file, the script runs as a system script and can be accessed at anytime by double tapping X  ..that's SHIFT-X-X

Of course it's up to the user to make sure that you are at the correct prompt required by the script being executed.

Here's an example of how the LS_Scripts.txt should be setup:

[scripts/path][TAB TAB][Custom Menu Text]

...you can put in as many TAB's as you like between script's path and its 'title'
